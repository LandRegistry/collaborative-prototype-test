# collaborative-prototype-test
testing real time collaboration on a proto - gov proto kit

disposable repo.

## Try tools for real time collaboration
- while we all work apart
- but it's a good idea, even if we are not working apart

- can, for example, 2 people work in the code base at the same time, be able to see those changes running.
- can this type of collaboration work with version control - as much as is needed.


## Try 
- Visual Studio - live Share
- browser based tools - glitch, others?


## Also
- what is Github co-pilot like?  Saw this tweet https://twitter.com/david__todd/status/1415251443125215234 about - because Gov is work in the open we get lots of design system suggestions
